THIS dynamic and interactive demonstration model may well just the next generation of deeper learning tools.

HAVING only played with this demonstration tool for about an hour, i quickly realised that the burden of understanding,
cooding and implementing the extensive list of APIs can be lifted and inter-relationships of existing models can EXPLORED to form
a deeper uderstanding of how deep learning can impact everybodies ives.

NO PHILOSOPHICAL, PRIVACY, LEGAL and ETHICAL frameworks or models, as far as i am aware, have not been conceptualized or addressed yet.

NOR has the evolving scope of their interrealationships.

THIS next-generation tool can also be used with existing "suspected fully trained" models for further tuning as new influeneces come into
play, such as deeper impact levels are encountered and realised OR if a finer level if granularity is required, 
especially when deploying them as social engineering tools.

PLAYGROUND is not simply a demonstration tool but an EXTREMELY powerful way of possibly predicting the impact of the 
collective's decision as to whether or nor (and if so, how carefully and at what rate) to deploy ONTO society.

INSTEAD of just simple images and auditory (promp[s?) being used as inputs, deeper CONCEPTS need to be added as primary influential layers
