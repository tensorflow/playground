TODO:  The label offset for POV-ray is problematic. The problem is that the labels are 
floating in front of the model, and I recently switched POV-ray export to export in 
orthographic mode and let POVray handle the perspective. This was important for 
other reasons. But as a result, a label floating in space in front of the atom will 
appear at a different location. An interesting challenge to figure out the algorithm 
that still places it in the "proper" place even when perspective is on. (Daniele Tomerini)
