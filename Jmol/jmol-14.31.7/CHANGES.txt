# THIS IS THE TRUNK - for development and release

# NOTE -- developement is moving to GitHub. See https://github.com/BobHanson/Jmol-SwingJS

# Developers: to add a description of changes you have made,
#  add it on a line below the "Jmol.___JmolVersion=..." line.
#  Don't use Jmol.___ in your text, as that is the key for stripping out
#  the information saved in the JAR version of this file.
#  The quotes above	 look odd for a parameter file, but they are 
#  important for the JavaScript version of Jmol.
#
# A full Jmol/JSpecView/JSmol release requires the following:
#
# 1. Generate a new version number. This should be done as in the following examples, 
#    listed in order of appearance:
#
#    previous     new
#
#    14.8.10  14.8.11-beta-2016-12-20 a beta release of 14.8.11 with a timestamp for Dec 20, 2016
#    14.8.10  14.8.11                 bug fixes only - patch level
#    14.8.10  14.9.1                  new features - minor version level (tag for Maven, create branch)
#    14.8.10  15.1.1                  new features - major version level (tag for Maven, create branch)
#
#  The distinction between major and minor is arbitrary.
#
#  Note that -beta releases will be to https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol-beta
#  while full releases will be to https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol.
#
# 2. Create a new Jmol.___... line and remove "Jmol.___" from the line for the
#    previous release; failure to do remove this line will use the original release number, 
#    not the new one, since this is a property file.
#
# 3. Commit this change.
#
# 4. Run jsmol build_11_fromJmol.xml
#
# 5. Refresh the JSmol project
#
# 6. Run jsmol build_12_tosite.xml
#
# 7. Run jsmol build_13_tojs.xml
#
# 8. Run jmol build.xml (including dist, which also initiates a release now)

new feature: SYNC sockets completely rewritten, allowing for substantially more 
             feedback and simpler JSON-based interface. Many features of the
             Molecular Playground now implemented in Jmol itself. Features include:
              - simplification of sockets, allowing for just one that is use for
                input and outoput
              - default short-message callbacks for all significant callbacks
              - added set XxxxCallback SYNC:ON and SYNC:OFF for subscribing to 
                full callback Object[] data information. 
              - better JSON creation/parsing
              - simpler class structure
              - allows Molecular Playground-like gestures to be socket-defined.
             
             This from org.openscience.jmol.appl.jsonkiosk.JsonNioService:
             
/**
 * A class for interacting with Jmol over local sockets.
 * 
 * See also org.molecularplayground.MPJmolApp.java for how this works.
 * Note that this service does not require MPJmolApp -- it is a package
 * in the standard Jmol app. 
 * 
 * Listens over a port on the local host for instructions on what to display.
 * Instructions come in over the port as JSON strings.
 * 
 * This class uses the Naga asynchronous socket network I/O package (NIO), the
 * JSON.org JSON package and Jmol.
 * 
 * http://code.google.com/p/naga/
 * 
 * Initial versions of this code, including the JSON-base protocol were created
 * by Adam Williams, U-Mass Amherst see http://MolecularPlayground.org and
 * org.openscience.jmol.molecularplayground.MPJmolApp.java
 * 
 * <code>
 * 
 * Sequence of events:
 * 
 * 1) Jmol initiates server listening on a port using the JmolScript 
 *    command with an arbitrary negative port number.
 *    (-30000 used here just for an example):
 * 
 *    sync -30000
 * 
 * This can be done also through the command line using
 * 
 *    jmol -P -30000
 * 
 * or 
 * 
 *    jmol --port -30000
 * 
 * Jmol will respond to System.out:
 * 
 *    JsonNioServerThread-JmolNioServer JsonNioServerSocket on 30000
 *    
 * 
 * 2) Client sends handshake to port 30000. As with all communications to this service, 
 *    there must be no new-line characters (\n) ANYWHERE in the JSON being sent EXCEPT 
 *    for a single message terminator:
 * 
 * 
 *   {"magic": "JmolApp", "role": "out"}\n
 * 
 * where "out" here indicates that this socket is for Jmol (reply) output.
 *   
 * Jmol will reply with the 30-byte response: 
 *   
 *   {"type":"reply","reply":"OK"}\n
 *   
 * (The client may see only 29 bytes, as it may or may not strip the final \n.)
 *
 * Optionally, the client may also indicate a specified port for Jmol input. 
 * But typically this is just the currently active port. 
 *   
 *   {"magic": "JmolApp", "role": "in"}\n 
 *   
 *   Jmol will reply with 
 *   
 *   {"type": "reply", "reply": "OK"}\n;
 *
 *  
 * 3) Client sequentially sends Jmol script commands over the "in" socket:
 * 
 *   {"type": "command", "command": command}
 * 
 * where required command is some JSON-escaped string such as "rotate x 30" or "load $caffeine". 
 * For example:
 * 
 *   {"type": "command", "command": "var atoms = {_C or _H};select atoms"}\n
 *  
 * 
 * For the rest of this discussion, we will use the Jmol command that communicates with another Jmol instance
 * rather than this JSON context:
 * 
 *   SYNC 30000 "var atoms = {_C or _H};select atoms"
 *   
 * in this case.
 * 
 * 
 * 4) Jmol throughout this process is sending replies that come 
 *    from the Jmol Statuslistener class. For example:
 *    
 *  {"type":"reply","reply":"SCRIPT:script 8 started"}
 *  {"type":"reply","reply":"SCRIPT:Script completed"}
 *  {"type":"reply","reply":"SCRIPT:Jmol script terminated"}
 * 
 * Note that your client will be subscribed to many of the Jmol status callbacks 
 * (see org.openscience.jmol.app.jmolpanel.StatusListener), including:
 * 
 *    LOADSTRUCT
 *    ANIMFRAME
 *    SCRIPT
 *    ECHO
 *    PICK
 *    CLICK
 *    RESIZE
 *    ERROR
 *    MINIMIZATION
 *    STRUCTUREMODIFIED
 * 
 * All scripts and callback messages run in order but asynchronously in Jmol. You do not need
 * to wait for one script to be finished before issuing another; there is a queue that handles that.
 * If you want to be sure that a particular script has been run, simply add a MESSAGE command 
 * as its last part:
 *    
 *    sync 30000 "background blue;message The background is blue now"
 *  
 *  and it will appear as a SCRIPT callback:
 *  
 *     {"type":"reply","reply":"SCRIPT:The background is blue now"}
 *  
 *  after which you can handle that event appropriately.
 *  
 *  The SCRIPT callback can be particularly useful to monitor:
 *
 *   sync 30000 "backgrund blue"
 *   
 *  {"type":"reply","reply":"SCRIPT:script compiler ERROR: command expected\n----\n          >>>> backgrund blue <<<<"}
 *
 *  Note that the ERROR callback does not fire for compile errors, 
 *  only for errors found while running a parsed script:
 *  
 *  {"type":"reply","reply":"ERROR:ScriptException"}
 *   
 *  Note that all of these messages are "thumbnails" in the sense that they are just a message string. 
 *  You can subscribe to a full report for any of these callbacks using 'SYNC:ON' for the 
 *  callback function:
 *  
 *     set XxxxxCallback SYNC:ON
 *     
 *  For example, issuing
 *  
 *     sync 30000 "load $caffeine"
 *     
 *  gives the simple reply:
 *  
 *     {"type":"reply","reply":"LOADSTRUCT:https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure/caffeine/file?format=sdf&get3d=true"}
 *
 *  but after
 *  
 *     sync 30000 "set LoadStructCallback 'SYNC:ON'
 *  
 *  we get additional details, an array of data with nine elements:
 *  
 *  {"type":"reply","reply":["LOADSTRUCT",
 *                           "https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure/caffeine/file?format=sdf&get3d=true",
 *                           "file?format=sdf&get3d=true",
 *                           "C8H10N4O2", null, 3, "1.1", "1.1", null]}
 *  
 *  Exact specifications for these callbacks are not well documented. 
 *  See org.jmol.viewer.StatusManager code for details.
 *  
 *  Remove the callback listener using
 *  
 *     set XxxxxCallback SYNC:OFF
 *  
 *  Note that unlike Java, you get only one SYNC callback; this is not an array of listeners.
 *  
 *  
 * 5) Shutdown can be requested by sending
 *   
 *   {"type": "quit"}\n
 *  
 *  or by issuing the command
 *  
 *    sync 30000 "exitjmol"
 *    
 *   
 * Note that the Molecular Playground implemented an extensive set of gesture-handling methods 
 * that are also available via this interface. Many of these methods utilize the JmolViewer.syncScript() 
 * method, which directly manipulates the display as though someone were using a mouse.
 *   
 *   {"type" : "move", "style" : "rotate", "x" : deltaX, "y", deltaY }
 *   {"type" : "move", "style" : "translate", "x" : deltaX, "y", deltaY }
 *   {"type" : "move", "style" : "zoom", "scale" : scale }  (1.0 = 100%)
 *   {"type" : "sync", "sync" : syncText }
 *   {"type" : "touch", 
 *        "eventType" : eventType,
 *        "touchID"   : touchID,
 *        "iData"     : idata,
 *        "time"      : time, "x" : x, "y" : y, "z" : z }
 *    
 *   For details on the "touch" type, see org.jmol.viewer.ActionManagerMT::processEvent
 *   
 *   Note that all of the move and sync commands utilize the Jmol sync functionality originally 
 *   intended for applets. So any valid sync command may be used with the "sync" style. These include 
 *   essentially all the actions that a user can make with a mouse, including the
 *   following, where the notation <....> represents a number of a given type. These
 *   events interrupt any currently running script, just as with typical mouse actions.
 *   
 *   "centerAt <int:x> <int:y> <float:ptx> <float:pty> <float:ptz>"
 *      -- set {ptx,pty,ptz} at screen (x,y)
 *   "rotateMolecule <float:deltaX> <float:deltaY>"
 *   "rotateXYBy <float:deltaX> <float:deltaY>"
 *   "rotateZBy <int:degrees>"
 *   "rotateZBy <int:degrees> <int:x> <int:y>" (with center reset)
 *   "rotateArcBall <int:x> <int:y> <float:factor>"
 *   "spinXYBy <int:x> <int:y> <float:speed>"
 *      -- a "flick" gesture
 *   "translateXYBy <float:deltaX, float:deltaY>"
 *   "zoomBy <int:pixels>"
 *   "zoomByFactor <float:factor>"
 *   "zoomByFactor <float:factor> <int:x> <int:y>" (with center reset)
 * 
 *

JmolVersion="14.30.3" 

new feature: FAHReader  FAH:: reads FoldingAtHome Top.json and FrameNNN.json files
 -- FAH:: is required for Frame files but not the Top file.
 -- automatic calculation of structure using DSSP
 -- Both files are required; three load options:
    
    LOAD FILES "ViewerTop.json" + "ViewerFrame22.json" // explicit joining to two files
    
    LOAD ViewerTop.json; 
    LOAD XYZ FAH::ViewerFrame22.json   // first the atoms, then the coordinates
    
    LOAD FAH::ViewerFrame22.json        // just the coordinates with associated ViewerTop.json assumed present
    
 -- Subsequent calls to LOAD XYZ will replace coordinates and recalculate DSSP only.

bug fix: CrystalReader fails to read models in CRYSTAL17 double-walled nanotube file tn0.out

JmolVersion="14.30.1"

new feature: (undocumented) set picking dragMolecule
 -- acts like set picking dragSelected
 -- LEFT-drag to translate; ALT-LEFT-drag to rotate
 -- useful for two more molecules (covalently bonded units)

new feature: set picking dragModel
 -- acts like set picking dragMolecule or dragSelected
 -- LEFT-drag to translate; ALT-LEFT-drag to rotate
 -- useful for two more models not loaded using set appendNew FALSE


JmolVersion="14.30.0"


bug fix: CrystalReader for slab nanotubes.
 - note that we are not processing the nonstandard helical symmetry operations

Note - The move to a new minor version (14.30) is due to changes in the 
------ Jmol Java/SwingJS application, not the JavaScript version. In particular,
------ changes in the way the org.openscience.jmol.app classes are
------ organized required taking this step.

new feature: set minimizationMaxAtoms
  - maximum number of atoms allowed for MMFF minimization
  - defaults to 200

new feature: MEASURE SEARCH "{[H]}CC{[H]}"
  - uses SMARTS searching, selecting only the specified atoms 
    (in this case, all vicinal hydrogen atoms attached to carbon)
  - actually available but undocumented since 2013
  
new feature: SET MEASUREMENTUNITS HZ
  - for example, set measurementUnits HZ; MEASURE SEARCH "{[H]}CC{[H]}"  will display all 1H-1H coupling constants for a model
  - display calculated three-bond (standard vicinal) H-H J coupling constants (SMARTS {[H]}CC{[H]}) calculated
    using Haasnoot-Altona-Karplus substituent electronegativity-adjusted algorithm instead of distances 
  - If there are fewer than three substituents on each central atom, or if
    either central atom is not carbon, defaults to general Karplus equation.
  - see org.jmol.quantum.NMRCalculation.java for algorithm and bibliographic details 
  - expanded from use in solid-state NMR to any model EXCEPT magres files, 
    which instead use HZ in association with solid-state tensors    

new feature: SET MEASUREMENTUNITS NOE_HZ
  - adds NOE calculation for H atoms that are more then three bonds apart
    along with vicinal and geminal
  - not validated; from Janocchio 1.1 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/janocchio/)

new feature: Janocchio application included as a plugin (preliminary)
  - Java only; totally experimental; VERY preliminary
  - org.openscience.jmol.app.janocchio
  - required some refactoring of Jmol app classes
  - commit number 22001!

new feature: LOAD ... CENTROID
  - for molecular crystal structures
  - loads one or more unit cells (as specified by {nx ny nz})
    exploring covalent bonding so that molecules that have their centroid
    (center of geometry) within the specified block of cells are built.
  - available but undocumented since 2011
  - example: load =cod/1001253 {1 1 1} centroid
    note that {1 1 1} here is unnecessary, as it is the default

new feature  intersection(ptLine, vLine, ptCenter, radius)
  -- intersection of a line with a sphere -- return list of 0, 1, or 2 points

new feature: (array-of-hash).pivot(key)
 -- turns an array of hashes into a hash of arrays of hashes
 -- like a pivot table for an array, but based on the value of a hash 
    key within each hash element of the array, not the element itself 
 -- returns a (hash-of-arrays-of-hashes) of the array elements grouped 
    by the stringified values of the specified key.
 -- for example:
 
 	a = [
 	 {label:"C3", id:1},
 	 {label:"C3", id:2}, 
 	 {label:"C2", id:3}
 	 	]
 	 	
 	a.pivot("label") = {
 		"C3":[{label:"C3", id:1}, {label:"C3", id:2}],
 		"C2":[{label:"C2", id:3}]
 	 	}
 	
new feature: (array-of-hash).pivot(key1, key2, ...,sep)
 -- returns a (hash-of-array-of-hash) of the array elements grouped by the values of these keys, 
        combined as a string using the separator given as the last parameter
 -- for example:
 
 $ load =ams/halite 1 packed
 $ invariants = symop(@3,@3,"array")
 $ uniqueOps = invariants.pivot("label", "axispoint", "axisVector", "+")

 This code is cataloging all of operators of space group #255 (F m 3 m) that 
 leave atom 3 unchanged -- invariant. There are 48 such operations, but some of

/**
 * A full validated relatively efficient implementation of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog
 * rules for assigning R/S, M/P, and E/Z stereochemical descriptors. Based on
 * IUPAC Blue Book rules of 2013.
 * https://iupac.org/projects/project-details/?project_nr=2001-043-1-800
 * 
 * Features include:
 * 
 *  - deeply validated 
 *  
 *  - implemented in Java (Jmol) and JavaScript (JSmol)
 *  
 *  - only two Java classes; roughly 1000 lines
 *  
 *  - efficient, one-pass process for each center using a single finite digraph for all auxiliary descriptors
 *  
 *  - exhaustive processing of all 8 sequence rules (1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5)
 *  
 *  - includes R/S, r/s, M/P (axial, not planar), E/Z
 *  
 *  - covers any-length odd and even cumulenes
 *  
 *  - uses Jmol conformational SMARTS to detect atropisomers and helicenes 
 *  
 *  - covers chiral phosphorus and sulfur, including trigonal pyramidal and tetrahedral
 *  
 *  - properly treats complex combinations of R/S, M/P, and seqCis/seqTrans centers (Rule 4b)
 * 
 *  - properly treats neutral-species resonance structures using fractional atomic mass and a modified Rule 1b
 *  
 *  - implements CIP spiro rule (BB P-93.5.3.1)
 *  
 *  - detects small rings (fewer than 8 members) and removes E/Z specifications for such
 * 
 *  - detects chiral bridgehead nitrogens
 *  
 *  - reports atom descriptor along with the rule that ultimately decided it
 * 
 * Primary 236-compound Chapter-9 validation set (AY-236) provided by Andres
 * Yerin, ACD/Labs (Moscow).
 * 
 * Mikko Vainio also supplied a 64-compound testing suite (MV-64), which is
 * available on SourceForge in the Jmol-datafiles directory.
 * (https://sourceforge.net/p/jmol/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Jmol-datafiles/cip).
 * 
 * Additional test structures provided by John Mayfield.
 * 
 * Additional thanks to the IUPAC Blue Book Revision project, specifically
 * Karl-Heinz Hellwich for alerting me to the errata page for the 2013 IUPAC
 * specs (http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/bibliog/BBerrors.html), Gerry Moss
 * for discussions, Andres Yerin for discussion and digraph checking.
 * 
 * Many thanks to the members of the BlueObelisk-Discuss group, particularly
 * Mikko Vainio, John Mayfield (aka John May), Wolf Ihlenfeldt, and Egon Willighagen, for
 * encouragement, examples, serious skepticism, and extremely helpful advice.

         fused benzenoid aromatic Mancude ring "Kekule weighted" atom number adjustments

 * Added logic to Rule 1b: The root distance for a Kekule-ambiguous duplicate
 * atom is its own sphere, not the sphere of its duplicated atom.
 * 
 * Stated more precisely:
 * 
 * Proposed amended Sequence Rule 1:
 * 
 * (1a) higher atomic number precedes lower;
 * 
 * (1b) in comparing two duplicate nodes, lower root distance precedes higher
 * root distance, where "root distance" is defined:
 * 
 * (i) in the case of a duplicate atom for which the atomic number is averaged
 * over two or more atoms in applying Rule 1a, the distance from the duplicate
 * node itself to the root node; and
 * 
 * (ii) in all other cases, the distance of its corresponding nonduplicated atom
 * node to the root node.

bug fix: set cartoonRibose misses the C1'-O4' and O3'-P(+1) edges

bug fix: CIP M/P chirality
  test: load "$2,2'-dibromobiphenyl"; calculate chirality; print {*}.chirality.join("")
bug fix: CIP chirality nearly fully validated on ACD/Labs AY-236 set, with some unimplemented aspects:

var skip = ({27 229}) || // E/Z only; missing chirality
           ({95 96 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 108 109 110 111 112 200}) || // trigonal planar, square planar, or hypervalent
           ({32 33})  || // helicene // added in Jmol 14.15.5
           ({201 202})|| // spirocyclic central (redundant) atom designation missing (axial designation option)
           ({212 213})|| // chiral conformation 1,4-benzene in a ring
           ({38 84})  || // ignore -- 38: Mancude for cyclopentadienyl; 84: unknown error with P compound
           ({203})    || // // chiral bridgehead amine  // fixed in Jmol 14.15.5

Issue: Full implementation of the rules requires a slight modification of Rule 1b. 
Specifically, aromatic duplicate atoms must reference the sphere of their own parent, not their
duplicated atom. 
  
 Three structures appear to be in error in the IUPAC Blue Book 2013. 
 
,"147":"r,,,R,,,,r,,,S" // r,,,R,,,,r,,,R chiral phosphine -- I think Jmol is right; disagrees with BB P-93.5.1.1.2 for S vs R

new feature: connect NBO <nbotype>
    - connect atoms in the currently visible model using a resonance structure configuration found in an NBO .46 or .nbo file
	- where <nbotype> is one of alpha|beta|46|46a|46b|nrtstr_n|nrtstra_n|rs_n|rsa_n|rsb_n
	 
new feature: label %[nbo];
    - label an atom using a resonance structure configuration found in an NBO .46 or .nbo file
    - requires a previous connect NBO

new feature: set nboCharges (default true)
  - determines whether formal charges are also displayed with LABEL %[nbo]
  
new feature: quintuple and sextuple bonds.
  -- connect @1 @2 quintuple
  -- connect @1 @2 sextuple
  -- readily saved in state
  -- adding MOL file bond type 15 and 16 for these -- a bit of a hack, of course.

new feature: Viewer.runScriptCautiously(String) replacement name for older Viewer.runScript(String)
 
new feature: plugin main menu item.
 - allows integrated additions to Jmol 
 - Just has NBO at this time; could have more, as it is a simple interface.
 - created automatically from reading org/openscience/jmol/app/plugins/plugin.properties,
   which just contains a list of name=class  pairs:
   
     # plugin.properties

     NBO=org.gennbo.NBOPlugin
   
new feature: startup options -U nbo  or --plugin nbo
 - starts Jmol in NBO mode, as if the Plugins...NBO menu item had been clicked
 - could be generalized, but do not that more than just nbo in place at this time
 - case insensitive

bug fix: SHOW CHEMICAL JME (from NCI CIR) does not properly return formal charges

bug fix: JSpecView, when open in application, does not allow ZAP

bug fix: draw POINTGROUP crashes Jmol if model is not first model

bug fix: DRAW circle rendering broken (load $2-butene ; draw pointGroup)

bug fix: NBO/ISOSURFACE command - Displaying BETA orbitals for NBO types (NHO, PNBO, etc.) that
         are from a file other than the current file causes read failure and no orbital display.   

bug fix: Viewer.runScript(String) now uses evaluateExpression(T[])

Lesson learned: Never mix viewer.runScript() and viewer.runScriptQueued() calls. 
                What will happen is that the unqueued calls will corrupt the 
                queued calls. However, if you use viewer.evaluateExpression("script('....')"), 
                that is also synchronous, and it uses a new ScriptEval() to isolate it from
                the script being queued. You still have the problem that the scripts could 
                mess up each other, but at least it will not cause catastrophic failure.
                

bug fix: *.CA should pick up calcium in a PDB file

bug fix: cfi format (for NBOPro) writing broken
  - from using the command
  
      x = data({*}, 'cfi')
   
bug fix: La and Ac should be in transitionmetal

bug fix: GenNBO reader not recognizing FILTER "BETA"

code: NBO options extended using the NBO VIEW or NBO OPTIONS "..." command options 

  protected boolean jmolOptionNOZAP = false; // do no zap between modules
  protected boolean jmolOptionNOSET = false; // do not use NBO settings by default
  protected boolean jmolOptionVIEW = false;  // present only the VIEW option
  protected boolean jmolOptionNONBO = false; // do not try to contact NBOServe

noting previously undocumented:

 set fontscaling true; font label 10 arial plain 0.020
 
  - last number is a fontscaling factor that allows one to set a font size for
  - labels in angstroms. Roughly, this pointSize * factor is in Angstroms.
  - if label is changed, one must use set fontscaling FALSE; label .... ; fontScaling TRUE;

new feature: Jmol now implements a way of indicating atropisomer chirality. 
 -- measured dihedral angle is clockwise-positive front-to-back, as for Jmol dihedrals
 -- matching with {*}.find("SMILES","...a^nm-a...") where n and m are 1, 2, or 3  
    indicate first, second, or third, respectively, and indicate which bonds of 
    the biaryl bond, as written, are to the reference atoms.
 -- for example:
 
   $ load $biphenol
   $ connect @{@7|@8} @{@1|@2} atropisomer
   $ print {*}.find("SMARTS","c1(O)ccccc1^23-c2c(O)cccc2")
 
  ({0:13})
  
  Explained below.
    
new feature: CONNECT {pair1} {pair2} ATROPISOMER
 -- creates a new bond of type atropisomer (bond chirality in biaryl systems)
 -- each pair must include the bonded atom and its reference connected atom
 -- example:
 
   $ load $biphenol
   $ connect @{@7|@8} @{@1|@2} atropisomer
   $ getProperty bondinfo[7].type
   
   bondinfo[7].type	"atropisomer_23"
  
new feature: BONDORDER ATROPISOMER_nm
  -- not for general use; will be found in state file
  -- for example:
  
    select BONDS ({6});
    bondOrder atropisomer_23;

new feature: Jmol SMILES bond atropisomerism ^nm- and ^^nm-
 -- indicates atropisomerism (bond chirality in biaryl systems)
 -- ^ and ^^ for bonds similar to @ and and @@ for atoms
 -- n and m are single-digit bond selectors, generally one of 1, 2, or 3
 -- n = 1/2/3 means "reference atom is first/second/third bonded 
 -- ^- and ^^- same as ^22- and ^^22-, respectively
 -- example: 
   
   $ load $biphenol
   $ connect @{@7|@8} @{@1|@2} atropisomer
   $ print {*}.find("SMARTS","c1(O)cccc{c1^23-c2}c(O)cccc2")
   
   ({1 6})

  Here the "^23-" refers to the two carbons with connected oxygen atoms, because the second
  bond listed for the carbon on the left is to the c1(O) atom, and the third bond listed for
  the carbon on the right is to the other c(O) atom. Note that bond numbering includes the 
  implicit bond to the atom coming from the atom on its left, which for the second carbon, 
  starts with the atropisomeric bond itself, at least in this case.

new feature: Jmol now implements a way of indicating atropisomer chirality. 
 -- measured dihedral angle is clockwise-positive front-to-back, as for Jmol dihedrals
 -- matching with {*}.find("SMILES","...a^nm-a...") where n and m are 1, 2, or 3  
    indicate first, second, or third, respectively, and indicate which bonds of 
    the biaryl bond, as written, are to the reference atoms.
 -- for example:
 
   $ load $biphenol
   $ connect @{@7|@8} @{@1|@2} atropisomer
   $ print {*}.find("SMARTS","c1(O)ccccc1^23-c2c(O)cccc2")
 
  ({0:13})
  
  Explained below.
    
new feature: CONNECT {pair1} {pair2} ATROPISOMER
 -- creates a new bond of type atropisomer (bond chirality in biaryl systems)
 -- each pair must include the bonded atom and its reference connected atom
 -- example:
 
   $ load $biphenol
   $ connect @{@7|@8} @{@1|@2} atropisomer
   $ getProperty bondinfo[7].type
   
   bondinfo[7].type	"atropisomer_23"
  
new feature: BONDORDER ATROPISOMER_nm
  -- not for general use; will be found in state file
  -- for example:
  
    select BONDS ({6});
    bondOrder atropisomer_23;

new feature: Jmol SMILES bond atropisomerism ^nm- and ^^nm-
 -- indicates atropisomerism (bond chirality in biaryl systems)
 -- ^ and ^^ for bonds similar to @ and and @@ for atoms
 -- n and m are single-digit bond selectors, generally one of 1, 2, or 3
 -- n = 1/2/3 means "reference atom is first/second/third bonded 
 -- ^- and ^^- same as ^22- and ^^22-, respectively
 -- example: 
   
   $ load $biphenol
   $ connect @{@7|@8} @{@1|@2} atropisomer
   $ print {*}.find("SMARTS","c1(O)cccc{c1^23-c2}c(O)cccc2")
   
   ({1 6})

  Here the "^23-" refers to the two carbons with connected oxygen atoms, because the second
  bond listed for the carbon on the left is to the c1(O) atom, and the third bond listed for
  the carbon on the right is to the other c(O) atom. Note that bond numbering includes the 
  implicit bond to the atom coming from the atom on its left, which for the second carbon, 
  starts with the atropisomeric bond itself, at least in this case.

FEATURE CHANGE: Jmol 14.5.4_2016.04.23 by default will implement DSSP 2.0 as described in
                Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15, 7841-7864; doi:10.3390/ijms15057841
                and implemented at http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/dssp.html.  
	            This change only affects helices that have bulges, indicating them
	            more appropriately as pi helices rather than alpha helices.  
	            
	            The original version of DSSP, "DSSP 1.0" will be available using 
	            
	            calculate structure DSSP 1.0

new feature: set window width height
new feature: set window [width height]
new feature: set window "xxx.png"
 
new feature: getProperty("shapeInfo.echo") 
 -- a 1-length array (because all shapeInfo results are arrays
 -- shapeInfo.echo[0] contains an associative array based on echo names
 -- currently only include keys name, imageWidth, imageHeight, and imageFile
 
	$ set echo myecho image 'http://noys3.weizmann.ac.il/a2jb/browse?sn=testSet/dna-a/pymol.png'
	$ print getProperty("shapeInfo.echo[0]")
	{
	  "myecho"  :

	    "name"  :  "myecho"
	   }
	 }
 
 -- idea is to allow access to image dimensions for any file image
 -- for example, for a MacPyMOL session file, because those do not contain width and height information,
    we don't have the width and height we need to recreate the model window and associated Jmol image,
    but we can also read the associated PyMOL-generated PNG file and get the dimensions that way 

	    load 'xxxx.pse' filter 'DORESIZE;DOCACHE'
	    set echo myecho image 'xxxx.png'
	    var a = getProperty('shapeInfo.echo[0].myecho')
	    set echo myecho off
	    write PNGJ @{a.imageWidth} @{a.imageHeight} 'xxxx-jmol.png'
    
    thus temporarily loading the PyMOL image just long enough to get its dimensions; not actually viewing it

bug fix: SET nihResolverFormat   does not work; using "=" does work.
		 (There should be no reason to set this; Jmol is automatically changing those to "https".)

FEATURE NOTE: Jmol now has a RELATIVELY COMPLETE set of analysis and visualization  
  tools for space group symmetry. All  standard and magnetic space group operations 
  are covered. Features are concentrated in four command options and one function:
  
  LOAD .... SPACEGROUP .... UNITCELL ....
  SHOW SYMOP ....
  DRAW SYMOP ....
  DRAW POINTGROUP SPACEGROUP
  x = symop(....)
  
  With these features, you can:
  
   -- load any model while applying any actual or conceivable space group or subset of a space group
   -- tabulate all space group operations associated with that model
   -- retrieve an associative array indicating all aspects of the operation, including
      point, rotation axis, plane, glide vector, lattice offset vector, and 4x4 matrix
   -- visualize all aspects of an operation, including proper and improper rotations
      inversion centers, mirror planes, glide planes, translations, and magnetic spin time reversal                      
   -- apply any operation to any atom or any point in space
   -- given any combination of two atoms or two points in space, determine and/or 
      depict the operation(s) that relate those to atoms or positions
 
 <<< above is not documented TODO 

                  
new feature: symop(3,@3,"atom")

new feature: show symop 3 @3 "atom"
  -- shows target atom or atoms 

<<< above is not documented TODO 


JmolVersion="14.5.4_2016.04.11"

new feature: symop() options:
  symop(op)
    -- returns the 4x4 matrix representation of this operator
  symop(op, atom) 
    -- returns the point generated by operator op on atom
    -- op may be a positive or negative integer indictating the operation (or its reverse)
       to apply from the loaded space group -- for example, symop(3, @1) or symop(-4, {atomindex=16})
    -- op may be a string such as "x+1/2,1/2-y,z" representing a specific generic operation
  symop(atom1, atom2)
    -- returns the description of the first of possibly several operations that take atom1 to atom2, for example:
       "2-fold screw axis|translation: 1/2 0 0" 
  symop(atom1, atom2, n)
    -- returns the description of the nth operation that takes atom1 to atom2
  symop(...point...)
    -- any place an atom can be used in symop(), one can substitute an xyz coordinate. 
    -- for example, symop(@1, {1/2 1/2 1/2})
  {atomset}.symop(...)
    -- when more than one model is loaded, prepending any symop function with an atom set specifies which 
       atoms, space group, and unit cell are being referenced. For example, {2.1}.symop(5) operates only on 
       atoms in the first model of the second loaded file, using the appropriate space group and unit cell. 
       In this way, "@1" will designate one atom only, provided only one model is showing (using the FRAME/MODEL command).
       If only one model has been loaded, there is no need to use this syntax; symop(...) will do the same.  
  symop(..., outputType)
   -- All uses of symop() and {atomset}.symop() can be extended using a final parameter that
     changes the default output described above to be something else. Options for outputType include:

     "draw"    Returns the Jmol script illustrating this operation with DRAW commands. 
     
       $ print symop(3,"draw")
        draw ID draw_* delete
        draw ID draw_frame1X diameter 0.15{5.5172 1.9683 2.7802}{6.5172 1.9683 2.7802} color red
        ...
        
     "full"    Returns the tab-separated Jones-Faithful string and descriptor for this operation.
     
       $ print symop(3,"full")
        -x,-y,-z(mx,my,mz)  	Ci: 0 0 0

     "lattice" Returns the lattice type associated with the space group involving this operation.
     
     "list"    Specifically when two atoms or points are specified, returns a string list of all operations
               taking the first to the second.
               
       $ print symop(@3,@21,"list")
			5	x+1/2,-y+1/2,-z+1/2(-mx,my,mz)	2-fold screw axis|translation: 1/2 0 0|time-reversed
			7	-x+1/2,y+1/2,z+1/2(-mx,my,mz)	n-glide plane|translation: 0 1/2 1/2|time-reversed

               Note that this string can be turned into a standard array using .lines.split("\t",true):

       $ print symop(@3,@21,"list").lines.split("\t",true)
		  [
		    5
		    x+1/2,-y+1/2,-z+1/2(-mx,my,mz)
		    2-fold screw axis|translation: 1/2 0 0|time-reversed
		  ]
		  [
		    7
		    -x+1/2,y+1/2,z+1/2(-mx,my,mz)
		    n-glide plane|translation: 0 1/2 1/2|time-reversed
		  ]

     "array"   Returns an associative array that contains critical information relating to this operation.
     
       $ load =magndata/0.34 
       $ print symop(3,"array")
		{
		  "inversionCenter"  :  {0.0 0.0 0.0}
		  "label"  :  "Ci: 0 0 0"
		  "matrix"  :
		  [
		  [-1.0,	0.0,	0.0,	0.0]
		  [0.0,	-1.0,	0.0,	0.0]
		  [0.0,	0.0,	-1.0,	0.0]
		  [0.0,	0.0,	0.0,	1.0] ]
		  "timeReversal"  :  1
		  "xyz"  :  "-x,-y,-z(mx,my,mz)"
		  "xyzOriginal"  :  "-x,-y,-z,m"
		 }
	 
	   In addition, all possible keys of this array may be used as well for outputType. These include:
	       
	       "axisVector", "cartesianTranslation", "centeringVector", "fractionalTranslation", 
         "inversionCenter", "label", "matrix", "plane", "rotationAngle",  
         "timeReversal", "unitTranslation", "xyz", and "xyzOriginal"

     Three of these that may be less than obvious are explained below:
     
     "centeringVector"  For operations that are pure lattice translations, returns the vector 
                        for this centering in fractional coordinates.
                        
     "timeReversal"     This quantity is 0 for standard space groups. Magnetic space group
                        operations also include the possibility of inversion of the spin
                        along with any 3D symmetry operation. This inversion characteristic
                        is referred to as "time reversal" and takes the value of 1 or -1. 

     "unitTranslation"  Symmetry operations involving two atoms may include an extra 
                        lattice translation if the two atoms are in different unit cells.
                        This translation is above and beyond any fractional lattice centering
                        that this operator incorporates for a face- or body-centered space group.
                        
     "id"               A number 1 - N, where N is the number of symmetry operators in the space group.

FEATURE NOTE: Prior to this version if the MO command was issued after use of 
              rotateSelected, the orbitals were calculated improperly, because the
              basis functions always must be applied for the original file coordinate
              frame, not the rotated frame. In addition, if MOs were calculated prior to
              use of rotateSelected or translateSelected, then they would not "track"
              with the modified atom positions. So MOs and rotate/translateSelected
              were completely incompatible. Jmol 14.4.2 fixes this issue. It should be 
              possible now to produce correct MOs before or after use of rotateSelected.
              Note that ALL atoms in a specified model must be moved in order for this
              tracking of MOs to take place. This functionality was introduced in 
              14.4.1_2016.01.28, but that version (never released) does not properly 
              check to see that ALL the atoms in a model have been involved in the rotation.  
              
FEATURE NOTE: If rotateSelected or translateSelected is used to move all atoms in a
              model, and after that the state is saved, then Jmol 14.4.2 
              will save a state that is not readable in 14.4.1. This is necessary
              because of the added FRAME ORIENTATION command, which is used in the states
              to indicate the relationship of a model to its file coordinates. The MO
              reader requires this so that it can rotate the coordinates back to their 
              original position prior to doing its calculation. 
              
bug fix: JVXL files saved from models that involve full model rotate/translateSelected
         do not get restored properly.

bug fix: molecular orbitals do not move with atoms 
         when full molecule is moved using rotateSelected or translateSelected

new feature: load =ams loads data from American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database
 -- many thanks given to Robert Downs and Alex Pires for enabling this functionality.
 -- fetches data from http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS 
 -- employs "#_DOCACHE_" flag because some of these data files may change after database maintenance
 -- three modes. Only the first, using _database_code_amcsd, is guaranteed to be stable over time,
   =ams/<nnnnnnn>  (seven-digit database code) loads that specific structure based on _database_code_amcsd
      load =ams/0014673
      show _modelfile
	  _modelfile = "http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/viewJmol.php?amcsd=14673&action=showcif#_DOCACHE_"
   =ams/<nnnnn>  (less than seven-digit id) loads that specific structure based on sequential id code
      load =ams/10000
      show _modelfile
	  _modelfile = "http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/viewJmol.php?id=10000&action=showcif#_DOCACHE_"  
   =ams/<mineralName> loads all structures for a specified named mineral. 
      load =ams/diamond
      show _modelfile
	  _modelfile = "http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/viewJmol.php?mineral=diamond&action=showcif#_DOCACHE_"
  -- thus, all of the following are equivalent as of 12/13/2015:
  
	    load =ams/0008986
	    load =ams/10000
	    load =ams/srilankite 4
    
     However, it is possible that new structures will be added to srilankite, making
     this not the fourth structure, and the five-digit code 10000 can change after  
     database maintenance.

JmolSQL

JmolSQL is a Jmol math syntax that is designed to query information related to molecular structure. The idea is that associative arrays, with key/value pairs, and especially arrays of associative arrays, are data, and those arrays themselves can be thought of as a mini database. These sorts of data can be found in Jmol in the a model's auxiliary info (variable _M), including validation data returned from LOAD =xxxx/val (_M.validation), sequence domain data returned from LOAD =xxxx/dom (_M.domains), and secondary structure information returned from LOAD =xxxx/dssr (_M.dssr) or LOAD=xxxx/rna3d (_M.rna3d). In addition, the getProperty() function returns a wide variety of data relating to model attributes, including getProperty("atomInfo") and getProperty("bondInfo") among several others.

The original conception of JmolSQL was in the context of the getProperty() function -- for example:

load $caffeine
print getProperty("atomInfo[SELECT atomno,coord WHERE shape LIKE 'trigonal planar']")

  {    "atomno"  :  1    "coord"  :  {1.312 -1.0479 0.0025}   }  {    "atomno"  :  3    "coord"  :  {1.7906001 0.20809999 9.999999E-4}   }   ...
More recent development widens this use to any array data, and use of the .select() function rather than getProperty() is recommended for general use. Thus, alternatively we can use:

print getProperty("atomInfo").select("atomno,coord WHERE shape LIKE 'trigonal planar' ")


object.SELECT("keys WHERE/WHEREIN phrase")
There are three parts to JmolSQL: object, keys, and an optional WHERE or WHEREIN phrase. The object can be either an associative array [key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3] or an array of associative arrays, usually all having the same set of keys.

Associative Arrays
When the top-level object is an associative array, .select() can be used to select
out subsets of that array, either as a single associative array or as an array of values.

abc.select("...")
The simplest form of .select() returns a subset of abc. Wild cards can be interspersed with additional keys, for example, "a*,b" or "*_id". In each such case, the case-sensitive LIKE operation is used to match keys.

abc = [ A:[b:1],B:[b:2],AA:[b:3, d:50] ]
print  abc.select("A").format("JSON")

{ "A": { "b": 1 } }
abc = [ A:[b:1],B:[b:2],AA:[b:3, d:50] ]
print  abc.select("A*").format("JSON")

{ "A": { "b": 1 },"AA": { "b": 3,"d": 50 } }
abc.select("(...)")
Using parentheses around the list of keys delivers a list of values of b for only the the subset of xyz for which a=1:

abc = [ A:[b:1],B:[b:2],AA:[b:3, d:50] ]
print  abc.select("(A,B)").format("JSON")

[ { "b": 2 },{ "b": 1 } ]

Arrays of Associative Arrays
In addition to operating on an associative array directly, JmolSQL can operate on an array of associative arrays. Generally we assume here that the elements of that array are associative arrays that all have the same set of keys. This is the essence of a database.  Whether or not the associative arrays have the same keys is not important for Jmol. For example, the getProperty("atomInfo") returns an array giving the information for each atom that is loaded:

load $caffeine
x = getProperty("atomInfo")
print x.count

24
print x[1]

{  "_ipt"  :  0  "atomIndex"  :  0  "atomno"  :  1  "bondCount"  :  3  "clickabilityFlags"  :  48  "colix"  :  -32761  "color"  :  "[x3050f8]"  "coord"  :  {1.312 -1.0479 0.0025}  "element"  :  "nitrogen"  "elemno"  :  7  "formalCharge"  :  0  "info"  :  "N1 #1"  "model"  :  "1"  "partialCharge"  :  0.0  "radius"  :  0.7416667  "shape"  :  "trigonal planar"  "spacefill"  :  0.3565  "sym"  :  "N"  "visibilityFlags"  :  63  "visible"  :  true  "x"  :  1.312  "y"  :  -1.0479  "z"  :  0.0025 }
These data can be "queried" using  JmolSQL.

xyz.select("...")
Creates the sublist of associative arrays having the selected subset of keys:

xyz = [ [a:1,b:11],[a:2,b:22],[a:3,b:33] ]
print xyz.select("b").format("JSON")

[ { "b": 11 },{ "b": 22 },{ "b": 33 } ]
print x.select("atomno,element")
  {    "atomno"  :  1    "element"  :  "nitrogen"   }  {    "atomno"  :  2    "element"  :  "carbon"   }  {    "atomno"  :  3    "element"  :  "carbon"   }  {    "atomno"  :  4    "element"  :  "oxygen"   }   ...
xyz.select("(...)")
Adding parentheses creates a list of only the values for the specified keys:
xyz = [ [a:1,b:11],[a:2,b:22],[a:3,b:33] ]
print xyz.select("(b)").format("JSON")

[ 11,22,33 ]
xyz = [ [a:1,b:11],[a:2,b:22],[a:3,b:33] ]
print xyz.select("(a,b)").format("JSON")

[ 11,1,22,2,33,3 ]
load $caffeine
print getProperty("atomInfo").select("(element)").pivot
{  "carbon"  :  8  "hydrogen"  :  10  "nitrogen"  :  4  "oxygen"  :  2 }
The assumption when using (keys) is that you want to know all these values,
but you don't care what order they are in (because that will not be predictable)
and you don't care about their exact context. An example is a list of bonds for
which we just want to know all the atoms involved, but the atoms are listed
under "atom1" and "atom2" in each bond array.

load =1ehz/dssr
select on @{_M.dssr.hbonds.select("(atom1_id,atom2_id)")}

206 atoms selected

Using WHERE
WHERE is used to select a subset of the elements of an array based on specific
key-value relationships.

xyz.select("... WHERE ...")
Delivers all key/value pairs in the subset of xyz element associative arrays
for which the WHERE clause is true for that element.

xyz = [ [a:1,b:11],[a:2,b:22],[a:3,b:33] ]
print xyz.select("* where a<3 and b<20").format("JSON")

[ { "b": 11,"a": 1 } ]
load $caffeine
print getProperty("atomInfo").select("atomno,element WHERE shape LIKE 'trigonal planar' ").format("JSON")

[ { "element": "nitrogen","atomno": 1 },{ "element": "carbon","atomno": 3 },{ "element": "nitrogen","atomno": 5 },{ "element": "carbon","atomno": 7 },{ "element": "carbon","atomno": 9 },{ "element": "nitrogen","atomno": 10 },{ "element": "carbon","atomno": 12 },{ "element": "carbon","atomno": 13 } ]


xyz.select("(...) where ...")
Using parentheses around the list of keys delivers a list of
values for only the subset of xyz for which the WHERE clause is true:

xyz = [ [a:1,b:11],[a:2,b:22],[a:3,b:33] ]
print xyz.select("(b) where a>1").format("JSON")

[ 22,33 ]
load $caffeine
 print getProperty("atomInfo").select("(shape) WHERE shape").pivot
{  "bent"  :  1  "tetrahedral"  :  3  "trigonal planar"  :  8 }
Note that "WHERE shape" here just excludes all cases where shape is the empty string, since empty strings in Jmol evaluate as FALSE. (In this case that involves hydrogen atoms.)

For example, finding all the hydrogen bonds created by DSSR for a given residue:

load =1ehz/dssr
x = _M.dssr.hbonds.select("(distance) where res_long like '*|A|C|72|*'");
print x.format("JSON")
print format("%5.3f",x.average)

[ 2.832,2.879,2.838 ]    2.850
Array "Drilling"

WHERE will "drill down" through arrays of arrays to find
elements that are associative arrays, returning a flat array of those objects:

xyz = [ [[a:1,b:11], [a:0,b:0]],[[[a:2,b:22]]],[[a:3,b:33,aa:44]] ]
print xyz.select("a* where a>0").format("JSON")

[ { "a": 1 },{ "a": 2 },{ "a": 3,"aa": 44 } ]
xyz = [ [[a:1,b:11], [a:0,b:0]],[[[a:2,b:22]]],[[a:3,b:33,aa:44]] ]
print xyz.select("(b) where a>0").format("JSON")

[ 11,22,33 ]
 
WHERE vs. WHEREIN
Starting with Jmol 14.4, JmolSQL includes an additional option, WHEREIN. This option
allows selecting specific key/value pairs for which the value is itself an associative
array, and *that array* has a specific set of key/value relationships. Thus, the
clause is checked one level deeper in the structure.

For example, given the associative array

abc = [key_1:[type:"a", i:1],key_2:[type:"b", i:2],key_3:[type:"a", i:3]]

we can select out only those keys for which type='a':

abc = [key_1:[type:"a", i:1],key_2:[type:"b", i:2],key_3:[type:"a", i:3]]
print abc.select("* WHEREIN type='a'").format("JSON");

{ "key_3": { "i": 3,"type": "a" },"key_1": { "i": 1,"type": "a" } }
All of the options that involve WHERE also apply to WHEREIN. For example,
multiple keys can be specified, and keys can be surrounded by parentheses
to return just the values instead of key/value pairs:

abc = [key_1:[type:"a", i:1],key_2:[type:"b", i:2],key_3:[type:"a", i:3]]
print abc.select("(key_1,key2) WHEREIN type='a'").format("JSON");

[ { "i": 1,"type": "a" } ]
In addition, WHEREIN can be applied to arrays as well as associative arrays.
In this case, the WHEREIN phrase applies to the elements of that array, which
are assumed to be associative arrays. For example, we can get a list of just
the occupied orbitals produced by Gaussian that are of a given symmetry:

load http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol/data/no2_nbo.log.gz 2 filter "alpha"
print _M.moData.select("mos wherein occupancy>0").select("(symmetry)").pivot

{  "(A1)--O"  :  6  "(A2)--O"  :  1  "(B1)--O"  :  1  "(B2)--O"  :  4 }
Note that this use of WHEREIN with arrays in this way can also be accomplished
more directly with WHERE:

load http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol/data/no2_nbo.log.gz 2 filter "alpha"
print _M.moData.mos.select("(symmetry) where occupancy>0").pivot

{  "(A1)--O"  :  6  "(A2)--O"  :  1  "(B1)--O"  :  1  "(B2)--O"  :  4 }
load http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol/data/no2_nbo.log.gz 2 filter "alpha"
x= _M.moData.select("mos wherein occupancy>0 and symmetry like '(B2)*' ")
print x.select("(index)").format("JSON")

[ 1,5,8,10 ]




After taking a close look at this, I decided this was getting too cryptic. I think this is much simpler. This long email message summarizes the JmolSQL business, starting with Jmol 11.3.16_2015.09.28. See http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/zip/jmol-14.3.16_2015.09.28.zip

JmolSQL
JmolSQL is a Jmol math syntax that is designed to query information related to molecular structure. The idea is that associative arrays, with key/value pairs, and especially arrays of associative arrays, are data, and those arrays themselves can be thought of as a mini database. These sorts of data can be found in Jmol in the a model's auxiliary info (variable _M), including validation data returned from LOAD =xxxx/val (_M.validation), sequence domain data returned from LOAD =xxxx/dom (_M.domains), and secondary structure information returned from LOAD =xxxx/dssr (_M.dssr) or LOAD=xxxx/rna3d (_M.rna3d). In addition, the getProperty() function returns a wide variety of data relating to model attributes, including getProperty("atomInfo") and getProperty("bondInfo") among several others.

The original conception of JmolSQL was in the context of the getProperty() function -- for example:

load $caffeine
print getProperty("atomInfo[SELECT atomno,coord WHERE shape LIKE 'trigonal planar']")

  {
    "atomno"  :  1
    "coord"  :  {1.312 -1.0479 0.0025}
   }
  {
    "atomno"  :  3
    "coord"  :  {1.7906001 0.20809999 9.999999E-4}
   }
   ...

More recent development widens this use to any array data, and use of the .select() function rather than getProperty() is recommended for general use. Thus, alternatively we can use:

print getProperty("atomInfo").select("atomno,coord WHERE shape LIKE 'trigonal planar' ")


object.SELECT("keys WHERE/WHEREIN phrase")
There are three parts to JmolSQL: object, keys, and an optional WHERE or WHEREIN phrase. The object can be either an associative array [key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3] or an array of associative arrays, usually all having the same set of keys.

abc = [ A:[b:1],B:[b:2],AA:[b:3, d:50] ]
print  abc.select("A*").format("JSON")

{ "A": { "b": 1 },"AA": { "b": 3,"d": 50 } }

abc.select("(...)")
Using parentheses around the list of keys delivers a list of values of b for only the the subset of xyz for which a=1:

abc = [ A:[b:1],B:[b:2],AA:[b:3, d:50] ]
print  abc.select("(A,B)").format("JSON")

xyz.select("...")
Creates the sublist of associative arrays having the selected subset of keys:

   }
  {
    "atomno"  :  4
    "element"  :  "oxygen"
   }
   ...
xyz.select("(...)")
Adding parentheses creates a list of only the values for the specified keys:

Using WHERE
WHERE is used to select a subset of the elements of an array based on specific
key-value relationships.

xyz.select("... WHERE ...")
Delivers all key/value pairs in the subset of xyz element associative arrays
for which the WHERE clause is true for that element.

xyz = [ [a:1,b:11],[a:2,b:22],[a:3,b:33] ]

Using parentheses around the list of keys delivers a list of

  "trigonal planar"  :  8
 }

Note that "WHERE shape" here just excludes all cases where shape is the empty string, since empty strings in Jmol evaluate as FALSE. (In this case that involves hydrogen atoms.)

For example, finding all the hydrogen bonds created by DSSR for a given residue:

load =1ehz/dssr
x = _M.dssr.hbonds.select("(distance) where res_long like '*|A|C|72|*'");

  -- generates unit IDs for atoms or residues
  -- unit IDs are a proposed general standard for representing atoms and residues in biomolecules

  $ print {atomno=3}.label("%[unitid-mrat]") // full unitID, right-trimmed
  1EHZ|1|A|G|1|OP1
 
  -- Note that the full 8-line unit ID is produced under all circumstances. 
     This is  important, because string-matching of unit ids will not work 
     without all fields completed. For example:
     
     |1|A|G|1
     
     would match
     
     |1|A|G|11
     
     without the closing "|". Likewise, 
     
     |1|A|G|11
     
     is not a match for the insertion residue
     
     |1|A|G|11|||3|
     
  -- [Editorial note: I agree that it was ill-advised to put the insertion
      code at the end. This makes it impossible to efficiently match 
      residues in full-atom unit IDs.]
      
  -- Note that in an actual atom label, one needs to add "\n" at the end
     and have the label in quotes in order to avoid having "|" mean "new line"
     
    label "%[unitid]\n"   
  
  not just
  
    label %[unitid]
  
  This is a consequence of having defined "|" as new line early on in Jmol
  development.

#ignore:
#new feature: SMILES/SMARTS atom designations [C(xxxx)]
#   -- allows pointing to the same atom without connection numbers
#   -- (xxxx) may be anything, including just ()
#   -- definition may be anywhere in bracketed atom specification
#   -- any additional primitives in referring expression will be ignored
#   -- involves only a very simple addition to parser code
#   -- Jmol is not currently creating these strings, just interpreting them  
#   -- rationale:
#   
#      One basic aspect of SMILES is that it efficiently uses numbers to 
#      indicate connectivity using a process of "opening" bonds and "closing" them.
#      Along with radical (.) notation, this is totally sufficient for describing
#      any connected network of atoms, including situations where the ordering
#      of connections is critical (e.g., in describing stereochemistry). Basically, 
#      one can simply list all the atoms in an arbitrary order as single-atom 
#      components (separated by "."), then assign bonds as desired, in whatever
#      order is desired.
#      
#      The problem comes when attempting to indicate stereochemistry for 
#      centers with more than six substituents or with geometries that are
#      outside the standard set of AL, TH, TP, SP, and OH. In such cases, 
#      there may arise situations where the ordering of unbonded substituents 
#      will be critical. An example is crystal structures of metals and metal
#      alloys. In this situation there are no covalent bonds. The need is to 
#      be able to compare two such crystal structures. 
#      
#      The solution is to create SMARTS and SMILES strings for complex 
#      "atomic environments" consisting of a central atom and any number of
#      nearby atoms, using a cutoff radius rather than a bonding pattern.
#      One possibility is to create a "pseudobond" that connects the central 
#      atom to all of its connected atoms, but this is not really necessary and
#      slows processing significantly. Instead, the [@PHn] syntax proposed here
#      allows the polyhedral environment to be specified only for the polyhedron
#      itself, exclusive of the central atom. 
#
#      By providing a means of referring to a specific previously defined atom in a
#      SMILES or SMARTS string, we can allow an atom in such an arrangement 
#      to be part of two different polyhedra.   
#        
#      Thus, although isolated polySMARTS can be implemented without atom referents, 
#      extending that to more complex multi-atom polySMARTS searches requires them.
#            
#   -- example, simple branched organic
#      
#		$ load $t-butylmethylether
#		$ select on search("[O][C(a)H0].[C(a)]C")
#		
#		5 atoms selected
#		
#      same as
#      
#		$ select on search("[O][CH0](C)")
#        		
#   -- note that [C(2)] and [O(2)] are not sensible and may be disallowed.

code: refactoring of smiles package

new feature: preliminary no-limit SMILES polyhedron stereochemistry @PHn
  -- very preliminary
  -- the format relies on specifying the order of bonds, so it
     creates a new component for each atom in the polyhedron, and it

     into the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the given (polygon vertex)
     atom and the (central) reference atom.

  -- allows quick check for enantiomers
  -- example: select search("/invertStereo/C[C@H](Br)CC") will match (R)-2-bromobutane
              even though it is for (S)-2-bromobutane
              
FEATURE CHANGE: Definitions of dna, rna, purine, and pyrimidine were ambiguous and 
                not particularly viable for group fragments. This is much clearer
                now: Fragments and P-only and N-only monomers are identified by 
                name only:
                
  // These masks are only used for P-only and N-only polymers
  // or cases where there are so few atoms that a monomer's type
  // cannot be determined by checking actual atoms and connections.
  // They are used for NucleicMonomer or AminoMonomer classes only as 
  // a last resort.
  //
  //             I  A G        
  //   purine:   100101 = 0x25
  
  //              UT C
  // pyrimidine: 011010 = 0x1A
  //
  //            +IUTACGDIUTACG IUTACG
  //        rna: 110000 000000 110111 = 0x30037
  
  //            +IUTACGDIUTACG IUTACG

bug fix: protein and nucleic are not set properly for non-monomer groups (Eric Martz)
 -- broken in Jmol 14.3.11 (12/13/2014)  
 -- general definition of protein is from having CA, C, and N. But there
    are situations where we know it is protein from its group name (ALA,LEU..)
    despite the fact that it is just one atom. Same for nucleic.
 -- note that non-canonical (HETERO) amino acids or nucleic bases that do not have
    the requisite atoms to identify them as such will still not test positive for 
    "protein" or "nucleic".

feature note: This version introduces several very powerful and very different capabilities 
              to Jmol in the area of crystallography. Many of these features are nonexistent
              in other programs.  They involve:
              
  - an extension of SMILES to compare bonding topology irrespective of atom identity. 
    (Are these two atom environments both iscoahedral?)
    
      x = {@1 and 1.1 and connected(@1)}.find("SMILES", "*"}
      y = {2.1}.find("SMARTS", x)
  
  - the generation of polyhedra in crystal structures for which only the central atom
    may be loaded. 
    (What is the atom environment around Au3 in this crystal structure?)
    
      load t.cif  // just the unit cell, maybe just one atom even
      polyhedra 4-12 UNITECELL @1
  
  - the ability to load a given block of space (such as a 10x10x10-Angstrom cube)
    with a crystal structure irrespective of its given unit cell. 
    (Are these two structures that have totally different unit cells really that different?)

      load t.cif FILL 20
      load t.cif FILL {20 10 10}
      load t.cif FILL [{0 0 0} {5.2 5.2 0} {-5.2 5.5 0} {1.3 0 3.3}]
           
  - the ability to show and draw the point group of a polyhedron

The file loader parses all the -- DATA -- information into arrays, so that can all be accessed using getProperty(). For example:

  print getProperty("auxiliaryInfo.models.aflowInfo['space group POST']") print getProperty("auxiliaryInfo.models.aflowInfo['Hf_atom [eV] (VASP)']") 

JmolSQL selectors can be used to select out specific records.

  print getProperty("auxiliaryInfo.models.aflowInfo[SELECT Cb,'Hf_atom [eV] (VASP)' WHERE Cb > 0.4 and Cb< 0.6]")


Jmol adds two additional fields, "fileModelNumber" and "modelNumber":

  print getProperty("auxiliaryInfo.models.aflowInfo[SELECT modelNumber,Ca,'Hf_atom [eV] (VASP)' WHERE Cb > 0.4 and Cb< 0.6]")

JmolVersion="14.3.13_2015.04.29"

bug fix: perspective renderer was using the wrong formula for calculating Z depth of pixels:

 * Note added 4/2015 BH:
 * 
 * Well, it turns out that the calculation of the intermediate pixel z value
 * in all methods involving rasterization of lines is incorrect and has been
 * incorrect since Jmol's inception. I noticed long ago that large triangles such as
 * produced in DRAW could incorrectly overlay/underlay other objects, but I could
 * never determine why. It turns out that the assumption that z-value is linear
 * across a line when perspectiveDepth is TRUE is simply incorrect. 
 * 
 * Basically, the function z(x) is non-linear. Treating it as simply a 
 * linear function results in oddities where lines and planes
 *  -- particularly created using DRAW and large distances -- appear
 * to be where they are not. 
 *  
 * Through Jmol 13.3.13 we had the standard linear relationship:
 * 
 *   z = (x - xa) / (xb - xa) * (zb - za) + za
 * 
 * I worked it out, and, amazingly, it should be
 * 
 *   z = (xb - xa) * za * zb / ((xb - x) * zb + (x - xa) * za)
 * 
 * Note that it is still true that when x = xb, z = zb 
 * and when x = xa, z = za, as required.
 * 
 * This equation can be rearranged to 
 * 
 *   z = a / (b - x)
 *   
 * where 
 * 
 *  a = (xb - xa) * za * (zb / (zb - za))
 *  
 * and
 * 
 *  b = (xb * zb - xa * za) / (zb - za)
 * 
 * These values must be floats, not integers, to work properly, because
 * these are extrapolations from long distances in some cases. So there is
 * considerable overhead there. It will take some experimentation to figure this
 * out.
 * 
 * The practical implications are for line, cylinder, and triangle drawing.
 * First-pass corrections are for axes and DRAW objects. They tend to be the
 * larger objects that result in the issue. 
 * 
 * Also affected is POV-Ray output, because right now POV-Ray is created using
 * perspective on and plotted as though it were orthographic, but although that
 * works in x and y, it does not work in z!
 *

bug fix: JavaScript drag-drop clears cache inappropriately when spt file is dropped

IMPORTANT NOTE: The problem described here only affects the reading of states that 
	have been created for crystallographic files, and then only if the 
	state was created in Java and then displayed in JavaScript, 
	or vice-versa.
    
	The problem is due to the fact that the Java implementation 
	of Jmol uses float values for atom coordinates, while JavaScript 
	is restricted to using only double values. The problem arises when
    a comparison must be made between two decimal values. After symmetry
    has been applied, it is possible for atom coordinates to be off in the
    4th-7th decimal digit for floats and 14th-17th for doubles in the
    range -256 to 256.
     
    The problem is most acute for inorganic crystal systems where 
    symmetry has been applied and especially after the CONNECT NONE command
    has been issued.
    
    Aspects where a problem might arise include:
     -- packing of unit cells, where atoms are discarded
     -- iterating over atoms, where atom order is important
     -- autobonding, where distances and order are critical
     -- comparing Cartesian or fractional coordinate values
      
    Solution to the problem is to automatically round all fractional 
    atom coordinates to a precision of 0.00001 and all Cartesian
    atom coordinates to a precision of 0.0001. This forces both
    double and float implementations to the same value and
    results in no practical error, since these ranges are
    well beyond the precision of atom coordinates in crystals.
    Coincidence is assured for fractional coordinates up to 
    about 126 and for Cartesian coordinates up to about 838.
    
    This rounding is not implemented for state or PNGJ file
    with state version v where
       
        v < 140206 || v >= 140300 && v < 140306
        
    and in general only in the case where the file coordinates are 
    fractional. Thus, those files will be read exactly as in the 
    version they were created by. And they will have have the same
    issues as well.
    
    The result is also much cleaner-looking atom coordinates. 
    For example, in JavaScript:
    
    print {*}.fxyz
    
	    {0.33333328149215147 0.999999891271352 1.0000000000000024}

RELEASE OF Jmol 14.2.0 Friday, June 13, 2014

new feature: readers with unit cells may load as trajectories

bug fix: CASTEP reader broken for multiple cells and geometry optimization

JmolVersion="14.1.17_2014.06.12"

new feature: protein sidechain minimization
 -- enabled by set picking dragMinimizeMolecule
 -- proteins only
 -- uses MMFF or UFF force field automatically
 -- important to use set pdbAddHydrogens prior to loading 
     to avoid stereochemical switch (ILE, THR, e.g.)

FEATURE CHANGE: jmolCommandInput 6th parameter added is default value
 -- defaults to "help"

FEATURE CHANGE: set useArcBall removed 
 -- no longer necessary; never documented
 -- arcBall is always used anyway
  
FEATURE CHANGE: removed UNITCELL "xxx" where xxx is an isosurface ID
 -- undocumented
 -- not necessary, as UNITCELL $xxx or UNITCELL isosurface xxx  does as well
 -- conflicts with new UNITCELL "parent" and other unit cell types
  
FEATURE CHANGE: REMOVED: set fractionalRelative
 -- an odd quantity -- related specifically to scripts commands
     using {1/1 1/2 1/3} and cell=nnn
 -- Its use with cell= was never documented.
 -- It makes no sense to change the unit cell and not change the 
     meaning of {1/1 1/2 1/3} and cell=nnn
 -- Only relates to situations where the unit cell has been offset.
 -- Its presence caused unitcell [{origin} {a} {b} {c}] to fail.
 -- It should never have been set in state, as it has nothing to do with the state 
  
FEATURE CHANGE: default space group names for Int. Tables # 39, 41, 64, 67, 68 added

new feature: x= format("JSON", data)
 -- simple way to generate JSON code.

new feature: x = format("base64", data)
 -- creates base64-encoding of the data
 -- data can be an array, a byteArray, a string, or a base64-encoded array
 -- prepends the string with ";base64,"
  	 
new feature: x = format("byteArray", data)
 -- creates byte array from the data
 -- data can be an array, a byteArray, a string, or a base64-encoded array
  	 
new feature: x = format("array", data)
 -- data can be an array, a byteArray, a string, or a base64-encoded array

new feature: load xxxx filter "CELL=va,vb,vc;oa,ob,oc"
 -- generic cell transformation during load
 -- applicable to any crystallographic file
 -- must be the LAST element of a filter
 -- operators are applied BEFORE this transformation
 -- can be expanded with {i j k} or {mmm nnn 1}
 -- can be used to create a supercell with or without offset
 -- reversed with "cell=!a,b,c:0,0,1/2"
 -- forces packing, with range based on specified cell dimensions
 -- example:
   load t.mcif filter "cell=2a,2b,c:0,0,1/2"

new feature: load xxxx filter "NOPACKCELL=va,vb,vc;oa,ob,oc"
 -- same as CELL=  except without any packing
  
new feature: load filter "cell=parent" or "cell=standard"
 -- for MCIF files (magnetic spin CIF files
 -- later, UNITCELL "conventional" displays conventional cell

new feature: set showUnitCellInfo TRUE (default)
 -- set FALSE to hide unit cell information display
  
new feature: unitcell "type"
 -- type can be "standard" or "parent" for now
     derived from CIF records
 -- "primitive" may follow
   unitcell "standard"
   unitcell "parent"
   unitcell "conventional"
   
new feature: unitcell "abc_offset"
 -- abc_offset is of the form "a,b,c;0,0,0"
     where a, b, and c, can be any expression involving a, b, and c
     and 0 can be an offset 
 -- numbers can be expressed fractionally or as decimals
 -- offset is optional, but semicolon is not
 -- effect is cumulative -- unit cell is NOT first restored
 -- reversed using !
 -- examples:
  
    unitcell "a+b,a-b,c;1/4,1/4,1/4"
    unitcell "!a+b,a-b,c;1/4,1/4,1/4"
    unitcell "a+b,a-b,c;"  
    
new feature: unitcell {555 575 0}
 -- 0 here means "draw these cells without internal lines"
 -- (currently) .uxyz does not scale
  
new feature: unitcell OFFSET and RANGE
 -- explicit parameters for unitcell {i j k} and unitcell {nnn mmm x}
  
new feature: unitcell BOUNDBOX
 -- allows calculation of positions relative to boundbox using fractional coordinates
 -- for example
  
     unitcell boundbox
     draw {1/2 1/2 1/2}
     unitcell reset
     
new feature: x.push(key,value) for associative array
 -- same as x.key = value; seems appropriate
  
new feature: x.pop("key") for an associative array
 -- same as x - "key"; just seems more appropriate
  
new feature: load ORIENTATION or load DATA "...orientation..." ...
 -- loads a file and preserves current orientation
 -- creates saved orientation "preload"
 -- shortcut for save orientation preload;load....;restore orientation preload
 -- example:
       load orientation "" // reload file with same orientation
       
new feature: V3000 reading of DATA SGROUP records:
 -- for example:
 		...
		M  V30 BEGIN SGROUP
		M  V30 1 DAT 0 ATOMS=(1 1) FIELDNAME=pc FIELDDATA=-0.2344 
		M  V30 1 DAT 0 ATOMS=(1 2) FIELDNAME=pc FIELDDATA=0.3344 
		M  V30 1 DAT 0 ATOMS=(1 3) FIELDNAME=pc FIELDDATA=-0.4344 
		M  V30 END SGROUP
   		...
   	then partialCharges, for example, can be set using: 
   	   {*}.partialCharge = {*}.property_pc.all  	
 -- optionally, if FIELDNAME contains "partial" then the atom's partial charge 
    is automatically set instead of property_partialCharge
 -- if more than one field starts with "partial" then the 
    first one indicated in the file is assigned to partialCharge
    and the any others are left as property_partialXXXX

new feature: moveTo AXIS [a,b,c,x,y,z]
 -- for example: moveTo AXIS a        
 -- rotates the model smoothly to a crystallographic or cartesian axis.
 -- in the case of abc, the rotation places the remaining two axes
     to the right and down (International Tables standard)
 -- in the case of xyz, the rotation places the remaining two axes
     to the right and up (standard Cartesian orientation)
 -- for abc, if no unit cell is available, a simple {1 1 1 90 90 90} unit cell is used
 -- added to application and popup View menus

new feature: JSmol: allow for a user callback for customization of menu
  if (Jmol._showMenuCallback)
		Jmol._showMenuCallback(menu, x, y);

new feature: show(xxx) function
 -- same as script("show " + xxx)

new feature: set showUnitCellDetails TRUE (default)
 -- FALSE removes a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma lines

new feature: unitcell RESET (or RESTORE)
 -- returns unit cell to original values and removes offset and scaling
 -- resets width to fine line

new feature: restore UNITCELL
 -- returns unit cell to original values and removes offset and scaling

new feature: show symop n "fmatrix"
new feature: show symop @1 @2 "fmatrix"
 -- gives rational fractional matrix
  
new feature: BilbaoReader NONORM option -- reads displacements as actual values, not normalized

new feature: load ... filter "symop=..."
 -- list of numbers separated by space, for example:
     load quartz.cif packed filter "symop=2"
     load quartz.cif packed filter "symop=2 3"
     
new feature: set echo depth x.x for standard echos
 -- works for 3D echos now as well as 2D echos
 -- values in percent of depth
 -- x.x >= 1000 are (x.x % 1000) in front of the 3D position
 -- x.x <= -1000 are (-x.x % 1000) behind the 3D position
    
new feature: set starWidth
 -- replaces set set starScale
  
new feature: menu item color--atoms--by scheme--vectors

new feature: load "filename" packed x.x
 -- x.x is the range in fractional coordinates within which an atom
     can be close to being in the 555 cell but not quite and still be
     accepted by the atom loading filter.
 -- default is 0.02
 -- in some cases, this adds too many atoms and can be reduced to 0.01 or 0.001
 -- modulation reader uses 0.001 strictly.
 -- for example:
  
		load t2.bcs packed 0.01
		{1.1}.property_dist =  {1.1}.distance.min({1.2})
		{1.1}.spacefill={1.1}.property_dist.all
		color {1.1} property_dist "bwr" range 0 0.5
		select 1.2
		stars -0.3
		set starscale 0.1
		frame *
		unitcell {1.2}
   
new feature: Bilbao Crystallographic Server file reader

bug fix: console not properly handling TAB key
bug fix: double-click drag doesn't drag the model, and 
         since double-click is determined by time, not location,
         it appears as though sometimes the model drags and 
         sometimes it does not. Solution is to
           a) add a localization to double clicking. I think that
              was removed because of touch interface problems.
           b) add left-double-drag to left-single-drag for standard rotation

bug fix: Jmol 14.1.12 broke atom.fxyz for models that have vibrations.
 -- atom.fxyz SHOULD change with changes in unit cell, but when an update was

 --IS case-sensitive (unlike "=")
 --examples:

new feature: "like" operator, strings only:
     a LIKE "x"    a equals x
     a LIKE "*x"   a ends with x
     a LIKE "x*"   a starts with x
     a LIKE "*x*"  a contains x
     
new feature: rich SQL logic in GETPROPERTY, getProperty(), and within(dssr,"xxxx.yyy..."):
 -- syntax: [SELECT keys WHERE expression]
 -- keys indicating only one key, such as "nt1", return just the value
 -- keys may be a LIKE wildcard such as "nt*" or "*nt" or "*nt*" (but are NOT case sensitive)
     also return just the value(s)
 -- keys * or */* means "return all values as an associative array"
 -- keys */nt1,nt2  means "return a new associative array including only keys nt1 and nt2"
 -- keys */nt*  means "return a new associative array including all keys starting with nt"
 -- if drilling to this associative array from a list,  * or */... returns an array of key/value pairs
 -- expression may be any standard Jmol expression that does not involve actual Jmol variables
     (instead, the variable names should all be the keys, and their values will be that given in the key:value pair)
 -- example:
	load files "=1ehz/dssr"
	x = getProperty("auxiliaryInfo.models.1.dssr.basepairs");
    print getProperty(x,"[SELECT nt* WHERE bp='C-G']")
    print getProperty(x, "[SELECT */nt* WHERE Saenger LIKE '19*']")
 -- keys may be "dotted" -- modelProperties.FreqValue -- but in this case
     the dotted key (FreqValue here) must be exact case. "modelProperties.freqvalue" would not work.
 -- example:

 -- n colors; simple interpolation from color1 to color2
 -- asHSL must be TRUE or FALSE; 
    -- when TRUE, uses hue/saturation/luminance instead of rgb gradient
    
 -- example:
  
	$ print color("white", "red", 5, false)
	
	 [xffffff][xffbfbf][xff7f7f][xff3f3f][xff0000]

	$ print color("red", "blue", 5, true)

	 [xff0000][xffff00][x00ff00][x00ffff][x0000ff]
	 
	$ set propertyColorScheme color("yellow","black",50,true)
	$ color property temperature

		
new feature: added simpler associative array notation: [key:value,...]
 -- no quotes required
 -- supplements {"key":value,...} where quotes are still required
     due to conflict with atom set chain descriptors such as {a:b}.
  
new feature: catchable THROW

 -- as in Java or JavaScript, allows a way of jumping
     out of a process. 

 -- outside of try/catch gives the expected error report:
  
   $ print "testing"
   $ throw "testing here"
   $ print "we will never see this"

	testing
	script ERROR: testing here
	----
         throw >> "testing here" <<
     
 -- passes a string as the variable thrown_value

	$ print thrown_value
	
	  testing here
	
 -- can be trapped with try/catch:

    try{
		  print "testing"
		  throw "testing here"
		  print "continuing"
	} catch(e) {
 	  print "thrown_value=" + thrown_value;
	}
	
	results in:
	
	testing
	thrown_value=testing here
     
new feature: asynchronous resumable processes

 -- THROW CONTEXT contextName

 -- throws a catchable error, but in the process of doing so,
     creates a script context that allows RESUMING
     at the point of the throw, unlike anything in JavaScript
     or Java (or perhaps like a debug mode).
      
 -- if within a try/catch phrase, is handled by catch.
     in which case the error message is simply the context name.

 -- if not within a try/catch phrase just reports 
      
       to resume, enter: &contextName
       
 -- essentially provides a callback into the running
     script, so you could, for example, put a running script
     on hold while you load a file, check variables, etc., 
     then continue. 
     
 -- can be resumed using RESUME CONTEXT or just & followed
     by the name of the context:
     
       &test
      
       resume context &test
       
 -- replaces PAUSE/RESUME, now deprecated.
  
 -- The current context returns to the highest level, however
     the variables in the context that was thrown are 
     accessible as though the context variable was an
     associative array. So, for example, if we have
    
     function f(a, b, c) { 
        var x = 5
        throw context testing
        print "x=" + x
     }
     
     f(1,2,3)
     print "done"
     
     The context will be saved as the variable "testing", and
     we can then test all the variables in that saved context, 
     (and change them before continuing):
     
     print testing["x"]
     
       5
     
     testing["x"]++
     
     print testing
     		
		_path	:	[script] >> function f
		_retval	:	0
		
		a	:	2
		b	:	2
		c	:	3
		x	:	6
        
 -- contexts can be restored using
  
     &contextName
     
     In the above case, we would get the report:
     
     x=6
     done
  	   	 
new feature: SAVE CONTEXT contextName
 -- similar to THROW, but does not stop processing.
     So in the above example, if we change THROW to SAVE,
     the processing continues, but after it has completed,
     we can change context variables and run it again.
     
new feature: show SAVED
 -- same as show SAVE
    
new feature: delete $SAVED savedName
    
  	 delete $SAVED Context_xxxx
  	 
 -- $ is important; case is not.
 -- allows selective deletion of saved objects
 -- Contexts always start with "Context_" but the subname
     "xxxx" in this case will work as well.

new feature: RESUME with arguments is synonymous with RESTORE      

new feature: Better idea for THROW:
    throw "this is an error"
    throw x
 -- that is, throw is like PRINT, not LABEL

bug fix: tensor("efg", "value") should return sparce array, not dense for missing tensors
bug fix: JSmol now allows writing POVRAY, MAYA, IDTF, VRML, etc. 
         both from Java and from HTML5
code: reworking of export classes 
bug fix: label @{math expression...} not working
bug fix: interpretation of x and @x in select commands and {...} phrases
 -- Variable substitution has been unintuitive and inconsistent.
     For instance:
     
     x = "C or T"
     
     select @x  -- works fine
     print {@x} -- fails
  
     The problem is the use of @ to reference the variable NAMED BY another 
     variable within a math expression (print context) but not a select context.
     For instance:
     
     y = 3
     x = "y"
     print x  --> "y"
     print @x --> 3
     
     Such referencing is important for math expressions, but the
     extension of this to atom expressions is not necessary and 
     not generally useful. 
 -- The current situation is as follows:
     
     x = "A or T"
     select @x   --> all A and T groups
     print {@x}  --> nothing (because @x is "the contents of the variable 'A or T'")
     
 -- This fix simplifies the situation by not allowing variable-variable
     referencing within atom expressions bounded by braces, just like 
     within implicit atom expression commands (select, display, hide, delete, etc.).
 -- The result is much more consistent. The following do exactly what
     you think they would do:
     
     x = "A or T"
     select @x
     print {@x}
     
 -- The current way of doing this, by defining a temporary atom
     expression using the DEFINE (or @) command still works:
     
     x = "A or T"
     @y @x
     select y       same as    select @x
      
 -- Note that the difference between "select x" and "select @x" 
     may be significant:
     
     ala = "cys"
     
     select ala  --> selects all alanines
     select @ala --> selects all cysteines

new freature: array.mul3(pt2) 
 -- applies mul3 to all elements of array

new feature: {atomset}.modulation(type, t) 
 -- delivers P3 (displacement modulation)
 -- implemented only for type="D" (optional)
 -- optional t is 0 by default

JmolVersion="13.1.13"

FEATURE CHANGE: multiple applets no longer share the same lighting space

new feature: animation DISPLAY {atomset} 
    - applies a filter to a running animation to display only a certain set of atoms. 
    - for example:
        load test.pse
        animation display {act_site}  // defined in test.pse
        
new feature: animation MORPH n
    - where n is a number of frames to be inserted between trajectories
    - requires previous LOAD TRAJECTORY 
      or the loading of a PyMOL PSE file having a movie (automatically a trajectory)
    - Jmol will do a linear morph as the animation runs.
    - for example:
        load test.pse
        animation morph 3
    - could be used for a linear morph between just two structures:
        load trajectory "test1.pdb" "test2.pdb"
        animation morph 32 // animation will run 33 frames

new feature: frame -x.y
	- negative decimals indicate a linear morph is requested between two
	  trajectory frames.
	- for example:
	    load test.pse
	    frame -3.5	      
                
new feature: set celShading TRUE -- produces cel shading effect
	- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel_shading
	- introduced by N David Brown

new Feature: Experimenting with ellipsoid {atom set} and ellipsoid $isosurfaceID

new feature: PyMOL PSE reader enhancements -- labels, simple surfaces, measures

new feature: isosurface xxxx MAP property COLOR 
 -- allows inheritance of color from underlying atom (as in PyMOL)

new feature: UHBD grid file reader
new feature: DelPhi grid file reader

new feature: load =xxx/ where xxx is a database code that can be set up in the future by a user. 
 -- currently including mp MaterialsProject http://www.materialsproject.org/materials/%FILE/cif
 -- along with ligand, nci, nmr, pdb, pubchem
 -- see JmolConstants.databases for the full list.
 -- note that nci can take an additional tag such as /names after the name, and pubchem can take one before it:
 
		load =mp/1
		load =nci/caffeine
		load =pubchem/caffeine
		load =pubchem/cid/2345
		print(load('=nci/caffeine/names'))
		
bug fix: set picking IDENT when picking is already ident can cancel a pending measurement
bug fix: applet does not refresh when mouse exits with pending measurement
bug fix: labels within fog should be hidden
bug fix: load CENTROID does not always work -- wrong implicit normalization flag (was -1 instead of 1)
bug fix: property_xxx does not work (since 10/3/12, 13.1.7)
bug fix: The "show  history" command is supposed to clear out the "show history" command 
         itself, but only if it is a top-level command (from the console), 
         but it does more than that if it is part of script("show history"). 
         Probably true with all recent versions of Jmol.
bug fix: isosurface binary file reading (MRC, CCP4, O, binary PMESH, etc.) broken
bug fix: JavaScript: zoomTo [seconds > 0]... and restore rotation|orientation [name] [seconds > 0]  not waiting

code: Refactoring class names to reduce JSmol JavaScript footprint
		ScriptVariable --> SV
		Token --> T

		Colix --> C
		Point3f --> P3
		Point3fi --> P3i
		StringXBuilder --> SB
		Vector3f --> V3
		JmolConstants --> JC
		
code: shader functions removed from Colix; Shader class made nonstatic
code: refactored to allow scriptless JavaScript. (reduces initial core code load size by 25%, to 2.5Mb) 
 
=============================================================================

version="13.1.12"

new feature: PDB reading of X-PLOR using hybrid-36 and NAMD files using hex
 -- see   https://www.schrodinger.com/AcrobatFile.php?type=supportdocs&type2=&ident=530
 -- see   http://cci.lbl.gov/cctbx_sources/iotbx/pdb/hybrid_36.py
  
new feature: load xxx.pdb filter "TYPE i,n"
 -- loads custom text fields into the "atomType" property of an atom upon customized PDB file loading
     where i is the number of the column (starting with 1) and n is the number of columns
 -- text is trimmed
 -- e.g. load xxx.pdb filter "TYPE 73,4" loads four characters starting at column 73 as "atomType" (segID)
 -- to convert to a numerical value, convert that to .property_foo:
     load xxx.pdb filter "type 22,4"; {*}.property_seqNo = {*}.atomType
     
new feature: PDB filter "TYPE 73,4=xxx" 
 -- loads four characters starting at column 73 (1-based) as "atomType"
 -- loads only those atoms with atom types starting with "xxx"

new feature: axes labels "a" "b" "c" "xxx"  where "xxx" is the label for the origin

bug fix: PDB file reading of remediated 1A7Y and 1E9W error due to too many CONECT bonds
	-- now reads HEADER columns 63-66 for 4-digit PDB ID. 
	-- only if this ID is absent will the number of CONECT bonds be checked in decision to autobond
	  
bug fix/update: revision of the pages that make the About menu (application) in each language. 
 -- Some changes that had been formerly applied to the English page are now in all.
      (Removal of copyright date in text)
 -- All About_xx.html files are now encoded and saved in UTF-8 w/o BOM, 
      except Chinese which is in GB2312/GB18030.
 -- Extended characters in tr and zh that had become corrupt across revisions were restored from old ones.
 -- Several html header tags updated or added (html5 doctype, charset, lang)
 -- Hopefully all will display correctly after these changes!

JavaScript: fix for SMILES matcher and   compare({*},{*},"isomer")
 -- j2s reminder: Can't use Java   new int[n][]; must use org.jmol.util.ArrayUtil.newInt2(n)
JavaScript: going to Float64Array for all noninteger arrays -- all numbers double
  Note that this could cause differences with Jmol, but I think we will have to live with that. 
  The problem was with (new Float32Array([13.48]))[0] != 13.48. So instead of trying to force
  floats, it seems to make more sense to me to force doubles, using Float64Array instead of Float32Array.
  Thanks given to Ira Hanson for clearing this up for me.

JavaScript: removing ambiguity in AtomObject in setColix(short, int, int) and (int, short, int)
JavaScript: binary Spartan SMOL reader enabled
   - nice IEEE calculator: http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/js-exact.htm#DW4
JavaScript: delay, hover, animation, vibration, moveto, spin, timeout
JavaScript: full binary loading for JavaScript -- tested only in Firefox, but specifically
      designed for Chrome's insistence that synchronized AJAX processes must not be binary  
JavaScript: base64 translation of encoded binary strings from JS file reading
      prefix: ";base64," initiates decoding.
JavaScript: com.json JSON package removed due to licensing issues
JavaScript: JSmol -- all references to InputStream.read(byte[]) --> InputStream.read(byte[], 0, len)
               to speed file reading processing
JavaScript: JSmol -- float[].clone(), int[].clone() not supported in Java2Script
JavaScript: java.text.DateFormat not supported in Java2Script
JavaScript: Note -- org.jmol.adapter.smarter.Atom is not fully cloned
              (anisoBorU and ellipsoid are not copied
               and their values must be considered "final")

code: adding quotes to above properties allows them to be used in JavaScript; j2sNative in JmolConstants.java
code: refactoring org.jmol.util into org.jmol.io and org.jmol.io2

bug fix: PDB 4B2Q, with faulty (incomplete) REMARK 350 not read

code: successfully refactored for JavaScript
	(see http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol-10-1/jsmol2.htm)
	-- note that all code development is done in Jmol, then
	   Java src code is transferred to JSmol project
	 
	-- adding:
		javax.util.BitSet 
		javax.util.StringXBuilder
	-- streamlining:
		javax.vecmath...
	-- removed all references to StringBuffer
	-- StringXBuilder allows optimization of performance in JavaScript
	-- workaround for Java2Script compiler bug setting "char x;" to 0
	-- Java2Script compiler is not distinguishing int[] from float[] when creating the array
	-- StringXBuilder takes care of adding ".0" to floats and doubles, but 
	   we need to be on the lookout for not places where we are constructing
	   a string where the difference between an int and a float is significant.
	-- optimize class hierarchy return by cataloging classes
	   as org_jmol_xxxx in addition to org.jmol.xxxx
	-- tie in graphics on JavaScript side
	-- add fonts
	-- add "billboard" objects such as labels, 3D echos, etc.
	-- add 2D echos
	-- ultimately write an asynchronous version of JSmol
	
code: org.jmol.jvxl.readers classes accessed reflexively (for JavaScript optimization)

new feature: write MOL adds partial charge data as > <JMOL_PARTIAL_CHARGES> in SDF format
new feature: isosurface CACHE <surface creation parameters> ....
 -- parameter CACHE along with isosurface creation or alone instructs Jmol to
     immediately create JVXL data for the specified surface and to load that data instead.
     The surface remains in memory (in this version of Jmol) can can be used again
     using cache://isosurface_<ID> where <ID> is the isosurface ID such as "isosurface1".
 -- The command ISOSURFACE CACHE alone will cache the current isosurface
 -- If the cache is no longer needed, then RESET CACHE will release the memory used to hold the JVXL data for the isosurface
 -- The result should be essentially equivalent to the original command.
     (It is recommended that the original be a relatively simple command, because not all nuances
      of an isosurface may be stored in the JVXL data.)
 -- THIS OPTION IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SAVING THE STATE AS AN SPT FILE.
 -- Instead, one needs to save the state in PNGJ or JMOL format, where the cached isosurface
     can be reloaded from a file saved in the  PNGJ or JMOL zip directory

FEATURE CHANGE: LOAD "myfile.xxx" with no additional parameters
    where xxx is "png" or "pngj" or "spt" 
    now assumes these are scripts and runs SCRIPT "myfile.spt" instead

new feature: write SCENE "xxxx.spt"
 -- creates pngj files
 -- using "xxxx.png" will STILL USE "xxxx.spt" but will create PNGJ files with ".png" extensions
 -- scene creation with linked PNGJ files
 -- xxxx.spt should include "pause scene n" commands, which are then
    used to separate the script into separate scenes. "n" must be an integer.
 -- Two files are created for each scene (pngj unles:
      xxxx_scene_n.min.pngj  very small; does not contain anything more than 
                             an image, JmolManifest.spt, and scene.spt
      xxxx_scene_n.all.pngj  adds all necessary files, plus script.spt
 -- Either of these files can be used, but if x.min.pngj is used, 
    then x.all.pngj needs to be present as well in the same directory.

=============================================================================

version=12.3.29

new feature: (JmolCore.js/JmolApplet.js/JmolCD.js/JmolApi.js)
 -- changes "useChemDoodleOnly" to "disableJmol"
    in preparation for non-ChemDoodle plug-ins similar to JmolCD.js
 -- allows for default values for Info
 -- adds Info.src 
   -- similar to src in an <image src="xxx.png" /> tag
   -- turned into LOAD "xxx.png"
 -- more efficient coding
new feature: set MESHSCALE (default 1) also allows isosurface/mo mesh scaling
 -- was DOTSCALE in 12.3.26, but that is not appropriate
new feature: Mopac archive reader, including internal coord. defs
 -- use FILTER "NOCENTER" to NOT center atoms in unit cell
 -- use CENTROID for complete molecules with centroids within unit cell
 -- use PACKED CENTROID for complete molecules with any atoms within unit cell 
 -- properties stored in auxiliaryInfo 
    use getProperty auxiliaryInfo or x = getProperty("auxiliaryInfo".foo) to retrieve
new feature: set pathForAllFiles "..."
 -- all files, local or remote, will be taken from the indicated path
 -- the indicated path may be a zip file entry (ending with "|")
 -- automatically reset to '' in case of an unrecoverable error in execution
 -- used for creating JMOL files containing user scripts instead of a state
 -- disallows all writing and image creation
 -- scripts including prompts to read wildcard files (for example, "load ?")
    will still prompt for those and read them properly
new feature: write SCRIPT ["scriptFileName", "filename2","filename3",...] PNGJ|JMOL...
 -- syntax is WRITE SCRIPT followed by an array of file names
    then whatever else is necessary to create the PNGJ or JMOL file
 -- for example:  write script ["wind.spt"] test.jmol
 -- Creates a single PNGJ or JMOL file that instead of containing the state 
    contains the script and additional files listed by the user. 
    The first script is run, and it is presumed that the other files are
    needed for full execution of that script. 
 -- Allows for creating PNGJ and JMOL files that run as animations, not just final states.
 -- Jmol will automatically add any files current to the state,
    but other files not indicated by the state (script files especially)
    required for the script to run need to be indicated by the user.
 -- When the script is executed, pathForAllFiles is set to the zip file
    itself. Thus, even scripts containing references such as "script2.spt" or "=xxxx" 
    can be run, provided the user supplies script2.spt xxxx.pdb.gz as one of the required filenames. 
 -- Note that if a file is saved locally using LOAD =xxxx AS t.pdb, Jmol will automatically use
    the local file reference to t.pdb, not the RCSB reference.
 -- If the file is loaded using only LOAD =xxxx, then Jmol will reload the
    remote file and store it in the PNGJ/JMOL file as xxxx.pdb.gz.

version=12.3.23

new feature: (applet) new interface for Jmol as an HTML object as well as full support on all platforms
             using a ChemDoodle fall-back option for Java/Applet-challenged platforms (iPad,iPhone,Android)

 Note that Jmol.js is no longer required, but not all of the features of Jmol.js are in place yet

 allows Jmol applets to be created on a page with more flexibility and extendability
 possibly using infrastructure of ChemDoodle for multiplatform doodlable structures

 required/optional libraries (preferably in the following order):

		jQuery.min.js   -- required for ChemDoodle or any server-based options
		gl-matrix-min.js -- required for ChemDoodle option
		mousewheel.js   -- required for ChemDoodle option
		ChemDoodleWeb.js -- required for ChemDoodle option
		JmolCore.js     -- required
		JmolApplet.js   -- required
		JmolCD.js       -- required for ChemDoodle option
		JmolApi.js      -- required

 Allows Jmol-like objects to be displayed on Java-challenged (iPad/iPhone)
 or applet-challenged (Android/iPhone) platforms, with automatic switching to 
 whatever is appropriate. You can specify "ChemDoodle-only", "Jmol-only", "Image-only"
 or some combination of those -- and of course, you are free to rewrite the logic below! 

 Allows ChemDoodle-like 3D and 3D-faked 2D canvases that can load files via a privately hosted 
 server that delivers raw data files rather than specialized JSON mol data.
 Access to iChemLabs server is not required for simple file-reading operations and 
 database access. PubChem and image services are provided by a server-side PHP program
 running JmolData.jar with flags -iR (at St. Olaf College). 
 For your installation, you should consider putting JmolData.jar and jmolcd.php 
 on your own server. Nothing more than these two files is needed on the server.

 The NCI and RCSB databases are accessed via direct AJAX if available (xhr2).

new feature: PubChem search for name (which can be a CAS number), cid, or SMILES using ":"
  from pubChemFormat = "http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/%FILE/SDF?record_type=3d";

    JmolCD.js -- Jmol ChemDoodle extension   author: Bob Hanson, hansonr@stolaf.edu  4/16/2012

    requires ChemDoodleWeb.js and ChemDoodleWeb-libs.js
    prior to JmolCD.js

    allows Jmol applets to be created on a page with more flexibility and extendability
    using much of the infrastructure of ChemDoodle.

    allows Jmol-like objects to be displayed on Java-challenged (iPad/iPhone)
    or applet-challenged (Android/iPhone) platforms, with automatic switching to 
    whatever is appropriate. You can specify "ChemDoodle-only", "Jmol-only", "Image-only"
    or some combination of those -- and of course, you are free to rewrite the logic below! 

    allows ChemDoodle-like 2D and 3D canvases that can load files via a privately hosted

    access to iChemLabs server is not required for simple file-reading operations and

    but for your installation, you should consider putting JmolData.jar and jmolcd.php 
    on your own server. Nothing more than these two files is needed on the server.

new feature: write CD  (simple ChemDoodle JSON format -- atoms and bonds only)
             For example: java -jar JmolData.jar -iRJ "load $tylenol;print write('cd')"
             generates:  {"mol":{"a":[{"x":0.20549999,"y":0.8303,"z":0.3823},{"x":0.6906,"y":-1.4656999,"z":-0.14220001},{"x":1.5485,"y":1.1359,"z":0.2829},{"x":2.0332,"y":-1.1585,"z":-0.24180001},{"x":-3.9799001,"y":-0.1617,"z":0.1295},{"l":"H","x":4.2731,"y":0.35680005,"z":0.7047},{"l":"H","x":-1.8655999,"y":-1.6522,"z":0.6012},{"x":-0.2273,"y":-0.4718,"z":0.17},{"x":2.4650002,"y":0.1425,"z":-0.029099999},{"l":"O","x":-2.1741998,"y":1.1759001,"z":-0.59169996},{"l":"O","x":3.7872,"y":0.4441,"z":-0.1268},{"x":-2.5170999,"y":0.1262,"z":-0.089999996},{"l":"N","x":-1.5898,"y":-0.78279996,"z":0.2712},{"l":"H","x":-0.50740004,"y":1.6029,"z":0.6296},{"l":"H","x":0.35450003,"y":-2.4786,"z":-0.3079},{"l":"H","x":1.8853,"y":2.1487997,"z":0.4477},{"l":"H","x":2.7472,"y":-1.9314001,"z":-0.485},{"l":"H","x":-4.3884,"y":-0.65880007,"z":-0.7504},{"l":"H","x":-4.0964003,"y":-0.8086,"z":0.9991},{"l":"H","x":-4.513,"y":0.7739,"z":0.2986}],"b":[{"b":8,"e":10},{"b":9,"e":11,"o":2},{"b":7,"e":12},{"b":11,"e":12},{"b":0,"e":7,"o":2},{"b":1,"e":7},{"b":0,"e":2},{"b":2,"e":8,"o":2},{"b":3,"e":8},{"b":1,"e":3,"o":2},{"b":4,"e":11},{"b":5,"e":10},{"b":6,"e":12},{"b":0,"e":13},{"b":1,"e":14},{"b":2,"e":15},{"b":3,"e":16},{"b":4,"e":17},{"b":4,"e":18},{"b":4,"e":19}]}}

new feature: (JmolData) -iR (silent, restricted) mode sends output from PRINT and ECHO commands to SYSOUT
             and also restricts the application to no local file read/writing

bug fix: "connect;" command in states saved prior to 11.9.24 and then read by versions after that
         The order in which Jmol created bonds changed in 11.9.24. Due to this, Jmol must check for the
         version number of Jmol used to create a state, and if it was before this point, it must
         apply "legacy" autobonding methods. Unfortunately, if that state from pre-11.9.24 versions
         contains the "connect;" command, which it would if someone used the CONNECT command by itself
         to regenerate all bonds in a model PRIOR to saving the state (Proteopedia does this), then
         those scripts will be misread in versions 11.9.24-12.2.21/12.3.21.
bug fix: antialiasDisplay does not show drag-box properly
bug fix: SMARTS syntax [${xxx}n] and [${xxx}m-n] changed to [$n{xxx}] and [$m-n{xxx}]

bug fix: Spartan 10 archives have .gz and .carc files. This fix adds .gz reading;
         work-around is that Spartan 10 allows saving of Archive without carc compression,
         which is a proprietary format. From Wavefunction:

new feature: MolecularPlayground now accepts messages to the banner:
  message banner: xxxxxxx
new feature: MolecularPlayground fully functional. 
             This application (MPJmolApp) is part of a three-part suite 
             that runs on a Mac mini involving:
                "Hub" [name]   for overall control (Mac app; not open source yet)
                MPKinectDriver for obtaining motion events (Mac app; not open source yet)
                MPJmolApp      for displaying the results (source here)
             The Hub and MPJmolApp communicate over local port 31416, sending 
             JSON messages back and forth. (See note in org.jmol.app.jsonkiosk.JsonNioService.java)
             For demonstrations of the installation at St. Olaf College,
             see the following YouTube videos:
                http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQRkuku8ry0
                http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCRrRZe1j6g
                http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTTIVWGtFD0
             For details relating to the original Molecular Playground
             installation at U. Mass.-Amherst, see
                http://molecularPlayground.org
             Note that all of the functionality of the original MP are
             present in MPJmolApp 
new feature: MolecularPLayground can now ignore all Hub requests for
             commands and content changes, thus allowing its own configuration
             script to drive the presentation instead of the Hub's. So the Hub
             can be used simply as an interface to the Kinect driver. This just
             allows a simpler development interface -- a simple three-column Excel file can
             be used to drive a presentation. (see org.jmol.molecularplayground.biophysics.xlsx)
 -- MPJmolApp looks for the file MpJmolAppConfig.spt
 -- This file can override MPJmolApp's default parameters:
         NIOContentPath 
           -- default: System.getProperty("user.dir").replace('\\', '/') 
                           + "/Content-Cache/%ID%/%ID%.json"
           -- ignored if NIOcontentDisabled ends up true (see below)
         NIOterminatorMessage
           -- default: "MP_DONE"
         NIObannerEnabled
           -- default: true
         NIOcontentScript
           -- default: (not present, setting NIOcontentDisabled=false)
         NIOcontentDisabled
           -- default: true if NIOcontentScript is present; false if not
         NIOmotionDisabled
           -- default: false
 -- The script in MpJmolAppConfig.spt is run, along with whatever
     default settings are generated by the above checks.
 -- Parameters are set by querying the Viewer for those Jmol variables. 
 -- If NIOcontentDisabled is true, then all JSON messages from the Hub
     of types "content", "command", and "banner" are ignored. It is still
     important that the running script send "MP_DONE" messages periodically
     (within every 6 minutes) so that the Hub knows that MPJmolApp is still
     alive and does not try to restart it.
 -- If NIOmotionDisabled is true, then all JSON messages from the Hub
     of types "move", "sync", and "touch" are ignored. 
 -- These are checked every time a JSON command is received, so the
     running script can specifically turn off motion detection if that
     or content detection if that is desired.
 -- Note that MPJmolApp has a full console and menu that are available
     on the operator's screen, (which is just mirrored to the projector).
     This allows for parameter setting and adjustments on the fly.
