# Setup

Welcome to your Tensorflow Playground project on Nitrous.

## Running the Tensorflow Playground  server:

In the [Nitrous IDE](https://community.nitrous.io/docs/ide-overview), start Tensorflow Playground via "Run > Start Tensorflow Playground"

Now you've got a development server running and can see the output in the Nitrous terminal window. You can open up a new shell or utilize [tmux](https://community.nitrous.io/docs/tmux) to open new shells to run other commands.

## Preview the app

In the Nitrous IDE, open the "Preview" menu and click "Port 8080".
